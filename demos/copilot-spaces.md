## OWASP Top 10 2021 - Key Security Risks for Web Applications

1. **A01 Broken Access Control** - Users can act outside of their intended permissions
2. **A02 Cryptographic Failures** - Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure
3. **A03 Injection** - User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application
4. **A04 Insecure Design** - Risks related to design and architectural flaws
5. **A05 Security Misconfiguration** - Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack
6. **A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components** - Using components with known vulnerabilities
7. **A07 Identification and Authentication Failures** - Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session management
8. **A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures** - Code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations
9. **A09 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** - Failures in logging and monitoring coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response
10. **A10 Server-Side Request Forgery** - SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL

## Next.js Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

## File Upload Security Considerations
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Malware scanning
- Secure file storage
- Image processing vulnerabilities
```

### Share your Space[OPTIONAL]

**This option is ONLY if you made the Owner an organization**

13. Select `Share` on the top right side
14. Update `No Access` to `Viewer`
15. Copy the link and send to the Option B Group.

**Expected Result:** A new Copilot Space will be created and opened, providing you with a dedicated environment for this development session.

## 🤝 Step 2: Collaborate and Share

**Goal:** Use an existing Copilot Space to complete the task listed below.

**Challenge:** If your group created the Space in an organization, switch Copilot Spaces to try out the other groups! I.e, if you choose **Option B** in the previous exercise, this time you will be following **Option A** exercise and vice versa. 

### Group A Option

1. Go to the Copilot Space
2. Type in the following prompt to analyze security vulnerabilities:

```markdown
I need help identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in our photo gallery application. Please analyze our file upload component and suggest:

1. How to validate file types securely (not just by extension)
2. Protection against malicious file uploads and XSS attacks
3. Proper input sanitization for photo titles and tags
4. Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for Next.js
5. Rate limiting strategies for upload endpoints

Based on the OWASP Top 10 guidelines, what are the most critical security issues I should address first in this photo gallery application?
```

3. Ask another question! What else do you want to learn?

### Group B Option

1. Go to the Copilot Space
2. Type in the following prompt to create comprehensive documentation:

```markdown
I need to create professional documentation for our photo gallery application. Please help me:

1. Generate an OpenAPI 3.0 specification for our photo management API endpoints
2. Create detailed component documentation with usage examples for our UI components
3. Write an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for choosing Next.js 15 with TypeScript
4. Improve our README with installation, development, and deployment instructions
5. Create a contributing guide for other developers

Following industry best practices, what documentation structure would you recommend for this type of application?
```

3. Ask another question! What else do you want to learn?

### Final discussion

- How were you able to collaborate with your team using Copilot Spaces? 
- How did Copilot’s suggestions help (or hinder) your collaboration?
- What would you do differently next time to improve teamwork and productivity?

Share your thoughts and any tips you discovered for making the most of Copilot Spaces in a team setting.

**Expected Result:** You will have successfully used AI assistance with industry-standard external sources to either conduct a security analysis or create comprehensive documentation for the Photo Gallery & Portfolio application.
